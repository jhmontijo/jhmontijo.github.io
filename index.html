								<h1>Jackson Montijo</h1>
								<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">I am a second semester senior at Cornell University studying Operations Research and Information Engineering interested in both Software Engineering and Product Management. Aside from professional interests, I love photography and spending time outdoors whether it be snowboarding, rock climbing, or anything in between. All the photos on this website were taken by me.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>My education in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) has allowed me to grow a wide variety of analytical skills. I enjoy applying a quantitative mindset in order to find efficient solutions to large problems, and am especially passionate about projects with a strong ethos. I am proficient in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and am especially strong in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. In addition to <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, I have been exposed to <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia </a>, and C. In addition to coding languages I have experience scripting in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">SQL</a>, <a href="https://ampl.com/">AMPL</a>, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/">VBA</a>. I am experienced in Github, Jupyter Notebooks, and the <a href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">papermill package</a> for parameterizing the execution of Jupyter notebooks.</p>
									<p> Another academic interest of mine is using mathematics and machine learning to study fairness and equity. A variety of ORIE courses: Introduction to Game Theory, A Mathematical Examination of Fair Representation, and Learning with Big Messy Data; have enabled me to study concepts such as coalitional game theory and fairness metrics in machine learning relevant to this.</p>
									<p>Outside of the academic setting I love spending time outdoors; being from San Diego, CA and studying in Ithaca, NY has enabled me to see some spectacular parts of nature. I enjoy photography, especially capturing beautiful landscapes or sights from unique angles. I have enjoyed rock climbing, backpacking, and snowboarding since high school and continue to be thrilled how these activities can lead to exploring new places. When I am inside, I am quite intrigued by DIY music, synthesizers, and music production technology.</p>

                                			        <h3>Machine Learning - Predicting Flight Delays Due to Weather</h3>
									<p>As part of my ORIE 4741: Learning with Big Messy Data course, two team members and I used a variety of supervised and unsupervised techniques in order to create a set of models that can predict the severity of a flight delay based on a weather forecast. We trained our model on flight data from the Bureau of Transport Statistics and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which produced a large, but very messy data set. We used both Python and Julia to analyze the data, build our model, and produce a variety of graphs and vizulations both of the limitations of our data and the performance of our model. The full report, models, and data are available on <a href="https://github.com/jhmontijo/ORIE4741-Jackson-Alex-Kais">github</a>.</p>

                                   				<h3>Product Management - Pocket PM (App for Junior Product Managers)</h3>
                                    					<p>For ENMGT 5920: Product Management, four team members and I performed user research on junior product managers to understand their pain points when beginning their career in product management in order to design a digital app that aids in easing this transition. Used this research as well as a variety of product management principles and activities to develop a feature set, prototype, and business proposal for our application. Developed KPI dashboards, product roadmaps, goals and milestones for the hypothetical product. As a final presentation, the group gave a 10 minute presentation on how we arrived at our product and our plan to move it forward.</p>

								<h3>Technical Communications - Engineering Communication in the Workplace</h3>
                                    					<p>Interviewed a Cornell Operations Research Alumni in order to understand communication practices in industry. Collaborated with a peer in order to synthesize what we learned into a report on how engineering alumni communicate and collaborate in the workplace as well as how engineering education may be able to better prepare students for workplace communication practices. We created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ORNpnD0Vg7th_HG1rZ2yKsk2ZjdfK3F4uxqoIT20WY/edit?usp=sharing">report</a> based on our findings, as well as delivered a poster presentation with our dynamic poster featured below.</p>
